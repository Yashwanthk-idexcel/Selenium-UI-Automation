Selenium Test Automation Interview Questions and Pattern based on my experience, helpful for beginners.

As I had attended the Selenium Java Interviews, I am sharing the experience based on my views here for few Java questions.

Each Interviewer expectation might be different, and They can ask some of the below or most of them in general.

1) Write a Java program based on the Arrays, Strings.
--> Arrays: They can give a Numeric array; we have to understand the pattern or logic and create the program to print values using basic conditional and looping 
statements in Java.
--> Strings: They can give any String and ask to write programs for different ways depends on interviewer.
Reverse String without inbuilt methods usage,
Remove duplicate characters in the String,
Reverse each word characters in an Sentence,
Using Regular Expressions

2) Explain Test Automation Framework Structure, Tools & Technologies, Reporting etc.
--> We have to give a detailed explanation on the folder structure, execution flow, CI CD execution etc. If we worked on Test Automation frameworks using POM, Data
driven, Keyword, Hybrid frameworks with TestNG, Cucumber.

3) Writing Custom Dynamic XPath for any given section or Web Tables, on an given website URL.
--> We have to use the XPath Axes methods

4) Scenario based on Handling Frames, Windows, Alerts, Dropdowns, Actions, Shadow DOM, etc.
--> Need to write and explain all the steps to achieve the requirement

5) Selenium theoretical concepts about Advantages, Disadvantages, Alternative tools in market, New features in Latest version (for example Selenium 4, Selenium Manager),
